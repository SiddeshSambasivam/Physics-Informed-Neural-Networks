<h3 style="font-weight:bold">Project Information</h3>

Purely data-driven methodologies in Machine Learning (ML) have been encountering challenges in practice, such as the requirement of the huge amount of training data, inconsistency of the predictions with the physical world (e.g. a negative prediction of stock price). There is an increasing awareness of combining physics/domain knowledge into ML for better modelling performance.

Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is a type of very popular algorithms with physics/domain knowledge integration into the training process of Neural Network (NN). 

PINN was originally proposed to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and it has been employed in various applications and has attracted increasing research interest in the ML domain.



An implementation of physics informed neural network to solve partial differential equations for both continuous and discrete variables.
